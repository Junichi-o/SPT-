I will then perform a grid search over the parameters (beta and s) to find the minimum total chi-squared value and the best-fit parameters. Finally, I will compare the results. I will start by defining placeholder chi-squared functions for CMB and Ia supernovae, assuming a simple cosmological model for now, and then combine them with the existing functions. This step focuses on steps 1-4 of the instructions.\n",
